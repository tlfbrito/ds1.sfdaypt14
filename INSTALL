Deep Space One
==============

Deep Space One is a demo project that guides you through the use and extension
mechanisms of the Symfony2 Form component.

Installation
------------

The project is based on the Symfony2 Standard Edition and can be installed just
like a Standard Edition project [0]:

1. Unpack the project directory to the document root of your web server

2. Add a virtual host configuration to your web server

3. Add the host name "ds1.sfdaypt14" to your "hosts" file

4. Make the app/cache, app/data and app/logs directories writable by your
   web server [1]

5. Install the project dependencies with Composer [2]:

   $ ./composer.phar install

5. Create and fill the database with the test fixtures:

   $ app/console doctrine:database:create
   $ app/console doctrine:schema:create
   $ app/console doctrine:fixtures:load

6. Dump the project assets:

   $ app/console assetic:dump

7. Open the project in your web browser and make sure that it works:

   http://ds1.sfdaypt14/app_dev.php

You can look at the code of each individual task by checking it out:
